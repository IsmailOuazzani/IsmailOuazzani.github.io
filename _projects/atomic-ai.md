# Introduction

The focus of this project was to create an AI system capable of playing Atomic Chess. The heuristic of the AI, that measures the strength of a move, is developped using a deep neural network. This function is then integrated with a search-based chess engine to enable the AI to play against humans and other AIs. By training the model on large datasets of games played by skilled players, the heuristic can capture the essential factors that predict game outcomes.
