# Introduction

Our objective is to create an AI system that plays Atomic Chess. We focus on developing a deep neural network model with a heuristic function. This function evaluates the strength of a chess board position for "white" and outputs a value between 0 and 1. Values closer to 1 indicate stronger positions for white, while values closer to 0 indicate stronger positions for black. We integrate this function with a search-based chess engine to enable the AI to play against humans and other AIs. Check out our GitHub for more information. Deep learning is a suitable approach for this problem due to the volatile and distant nature of determining a position's strength. By training our model on large datasets of games played by skilled players, we aim to capture the essential factors that predict game outcomes. Deep learning has proven effective in both traditional chess and the crazyhouse variant.
