This week, I had the opportunity to attend IEEE's International Conference of Robotics and Automation, or in short, <a href="https://www.icra2023.org/">ICRA</a>, in London. In this post, I describe my favorite papers and some key takeaways.

## A Complete Set of Connectivity-aware Local Topology Manipulation Operations for Robot Swarms <d-cite key=khateri2022complete></d-cite>

This paper presents evidence of a set of topological transformations that can convert one tree into another. In simpler terms, it demonstrates that a fully connected swarm of robots, with no cyclic connections, can be reconfigured into any other fully connected structure without cycles.

In various applications, maintaining connectivity within a swarm of robots is crucial. Let's say you're conducting a search and rescue mission using drones in an area without internet coverage. It's essential to keep communication with the drones, even when they are widely dispersed to maximize the area covered. This paper's findings enable the swarm to reorganize itself while preserving communication, without requiring each drone to have complete knowledge of the positions of all other drones. This capability becomes especially valuable when dealing with a large number of drones and communication delays.

One potential improvement for the future is to develop algorithms that can create various shapes for the entire swarm by utilizing local operations. Presently, the researchers have successfully achieved line and star formations using these algorithms. Another intriguing aspect that could be explored further in the paper is the ability to reprogram specific parts of the swarm. For instance, if a line formation is initially desired to optimize distance, but a new task arises that requires multiple drones positioned halfway through the chain, it would be interesting to investigate if the swarm can dynamically reorganize itself using these local operations.

## Decentralized Planner for Multi-Robot Coverage <d-cite key="sharma2022d2coplan"></d-cite>

The main objective of this paper is to provide a decentralized solution for multi-robot systems to efficiently survey an area with minimal overlap. In other words, when there are multiple targets on the ground, drones communicate with their neighboring drones to plan their movements in an efficient manner.

Each drone's "brain" consists of two components. First, there is a perception network that allows the drone to perceive the number of targets on the ground. Second, there is a planner network that provides the drone with actions to execute at each time step, such as moving in a specific direction or remaining stationary.

What makes this approach interesting is that both the perception network and the planner network are interconnected. This means they are trained together, resulting in improved performance compared to traditional planners. The interconnection between these networks also justifies the necessity of a differentiable planner network. The differentiability ensures that backpropagation can propagate all the way from the planner network to the perception network, enabling effective training and learning.
