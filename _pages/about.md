Hi, I'm Ismail !

I'm a robotics engineering student at the University of Toronto, and I'm passionate about deep learning and robotics. 

I am currently searching for Co-op positions in industry for September 2023. If you know of any interesting opportunities or would like to have a conversation over coffee, I'd love to connect.
