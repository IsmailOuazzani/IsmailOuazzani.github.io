      description:
        During my internip, I contributed to the development of an open-source drone for swarm robotics experiments. I developed code on a Raspberry pi to enable obstacle detection through range sensors. Additionally, I designed and 3D-printed structural components to accommodate a substantial increase in the drone's weight. Finally, I documented my contributions and improved the troubleshooting guide for the project's open-source GitHub repository.

      year: Sep 2022 - Dec 2022
      description: In our robotics class, we designed a control system for simulating a Mail Delivery Robot. Our task was to enable the robot to navigate a topological map of an office track and stop at specific offices. We implemented Bayesian Localization and a PID controller to achieve this. By leveraging a TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi equipped with a Pi Camera, we utilized color detection and line following techniques. We successfully implemented the system and gained valuable experience in prototyping and debugging, deepening our understanding of robotics concepts.
