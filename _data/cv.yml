      description:
        During my internip, I contributed to the development of an open-source drone for swarm robotics experiments. I developed code on a Raspberry pi to enable obstacle detection through range sensors. Additionally, I designed and 3D-printed structural components to accommodate a substantial increase in the drone's weight. Finally, I documented my contributions and improved the troubleshooting guide for the project's open-source GitHub repository.
